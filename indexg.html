    <h1>HTML Documentaion structure</h1>
    <p>HTML documents include a document type declaration and the <html> root element. Nested in the <html> element are
        the document head and document body. While the head of the document isn't visible to the sighted visitor, it is
        vital to make your site function. It contains all the meta information, including information for search engines
        and social media results, icons for the browser tab and mobile home screen shortcut, and the behavior and
        presentation of your content. In this section, you'll discover the components that, while not visible, are
        present on almost every web page.
        To create the <i>MachineLearningWorkshop.com (MLW)</i> site, start by including the components that should be
        considered essential for every web page: the type of document, the content's human language, the character set,
        and, of course, the title or name of the site or application.
    </p>

    <h3>!DOCTYPE html</h3>
    <p>The first thing in any HTML document is the preamble. For <i>HTML, all you need is This may look like an HTML
            element</i>, but it isn't. It's a special kind of node called "doctype". The doctype tells the browser to
        use standards mode. If omitted, browsers will use a different rendering mode known as quirks mode. Including the
        doctype helps prevent quirks mode.</p>

    <h4>html</h4>
    <P>The <html> element is the root element for an HTML document. It is the parent of the

        <head> and

        <body>, containing everything in the HTML document other than the doctype. If omitted it will be implied, but it
            is important to include it, as this is the element on which the language of the content of the document is
            declared.</P>

    <h4>content launguage</h4>
    <p>The lang language attribute added to the <html> tag defines the main language of the document. The value of the
        lang attribute is a two- or three-letter ISO language code followed by the region. The region is optional, but
        recommended, as a language can vary greatly between regions. For example, French is very different in Canada
        (fr-CA) versus Burkina Faso (fr-BF). This language declaration enables screen readers, search engines, and
        translation services to know the document language.

        The lang attribute is not limited to the html tag. If there is text within the page that is in a language
        different from the main document language, the lang attribute should be used to identify exceptions to the main
        language within the document. Just like when it is included in the head, the lang attribute in the body has no
        visual effect. It only adds semantics, enabling assistive technologies and automated services to know the
        language of the impacted content.

        In addition to setting the language for the document and exceptions to that base language, the attribute can be
        used in CSS selectors.
    </p>

    <h4>head</h4>
    <p>Nested between the opening and closing <b>html tags,</b> we find the two children: head and body:
        The

        <head>, or document metadata header, contains all the metadata for a site or application. The body contains the
            visible content. The rest of this section focuses on the components found nested inside the opening and
            closing

            <head></head>

    </p>

    <h4>Required components inside head</h4>
    <p>The document metadata, including the document title, character set, viewport settings, description, base URL,
        stylesheet links, and icons, are found in the

        <head> element. While you may not need all these features, always include character set, title, and viewport
            settings.
